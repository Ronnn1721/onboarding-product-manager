What security measures do you currently follow, and where can you improve?
# There are many things I currently follow. Such as, strong and unique password with both upper and lower case letters as well as digits; Regular updates to patch vulnerabilities; Avoiding suspicious links ; Enabled 2FA on critical accounts. However, my password will not update consistantly, I usually dont change it at all.

How can you make secure behaviour a habit rather than an afterthought?
# Enable auto-updates and auto-lock on devices, e.g auto-lock my account after 6 times password failed.

What steps will you take to ensure your passwords and accounts are secure?
# Set backup email or phone and security questions.

What would you do if you suspected a security breach or suspicious activity on your account?
# I will check check account security settings. Then add MFA and change passwords.
